runtimeexception, checked exception unchecked exception

Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. 
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. 
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands, whereas DELETE is a DML command.
truncate is not "transactional" in the sense that it commits and can't be rolled back, and can modify object storage attributes. 
So it's not ordinary DML - Oracle classifies it as DDL(Data Definition Language). delete is an ordinary DML  (Data Manipulation Language) statement.

@autowired Vs @inject
Both of these annotations use the 'AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor' to inject dependencies. 
'@Autowired' and '@Inject' can be used interchangeable to inject Spring beans. However 
the '@Resource' annotation uses the 'CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor' to inject dependencies.

The @Resource annotation is part of the JSR-250 annotation collection and is packaged with Java EE. 
This annotation has the following execution paths, listed by precedence:
Match by Name
Match by Type
Match by Qualifier


SOLID principle
Single responsibility principle[6]
a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).
Open/closed principle[7]
"software entities Ö should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
Liskov substitution principle[8]
"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
Interface segregation principle[9]
"many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]
Dependency inversion principle[10]
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4]

six thread states:  runnable, blocked, waiting, timed_waiting, new, terminated.
RUNNABLE The thread is actively invoking code (native methods, native machine code)
WAITING The threat will wait indefinitely unless some other thread wakes it up.   <<  Object.wait()  << LockSupport.park()
TIMED_WAITING timed waiting  << Thread.sleep(time)  << LockSupport.parkNanos()
BLOCKED  The thread is waiting for a monitor lock to become available.


threads   TRANSIENT
transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes. When an object is transferred through the network, the object needs to be 'serialized'. Serialization converts the object state to serial bytes.

The fundamental difference is wait() is from Object and sleep() 
is static method of Thread . The major difference is that wait() releases the lock while sleep() doesn't releas any lock while waiting. The wait() is used for inter-thread communication while sleep() is used to introduce pause on execution, generally.

The most obvious difference is that the JPA specification defines the persist method. You can use it with all JPA implementations. The save method, on the other hand, is Hibernate-specific. It is, therefore, not available in other JPA implementations.
Another obvious difference between these 2 methods is their return type. JPAís persist method returns void and Hibernateís save method returns the primary key of the entity.
Hibernate executes the same SQL statements when you call the persist or the save method. Which and when it does that depends on your primary key generation strategy:
>>>Not generated<<<
If you set the primary key value programmatically, e.g. to a natural identifier, Hibernate only performs an SQL INSERT statement when it flushes the persistence context.
>>>Generated with IDENTITY strategy<<<
If you use the IDENTITY strategy to generate the primary key value, Hibernate needs to execute the INSERT statement when you call the save or persist method to retrieve the primary key value from the database.
>>>Generated with SEQUENCE strategy<<<
And if you use the SEQUENCE, Hibernate performs an SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the next value from the database sequence. Hibernate then delays the INSERT statement until it flushes the persistence context. In this example, the flush happens when the transaction gets committed.
>>>Generated with TABLE strategy<<<
You shouldnít use the TABLE strategy because it requires row level locks on the primary key table and doesnít scale well. If you use this strategy anyways, Hibernate performs an SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the next primary key value from the database and writes the new value to the database table. It delays the execution of the SQL INSERT statement for the new entity until it flushes the persistence context.

    HAVING filters records that work on summarized GROUP BY results.
    HAVING applies to summarized group records, whereas WHERE applies to individual records.
    Only the groups that meet the HAVING criteria will be returned.
    HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is present.
    WHERE and HAVING can be in the same query.

Greatest Sum: Write a function that, given a list of integers (both positive and negative)
-- returns the sum of the contiguous subsequence with maximum sum. 						
-- Thus, given the sequence (1, 2, -4, 1, 3, -2, 3, -1) it should return 5.

Master Data versus Reference Data
Master data is defined as data about the key business entities of an organization. Examples include customer, product, organizational structure, and chart of accounts. A common question about master data is, ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between master data and reference data?‚Äù Some people take the position that they are the same thing, but it can be argued that not all reference data is master data. For example, lookup and code tables that are used to encode information, such as state names and order codes, are not strictly master data tables.

The diving line between master data and reference data is not always clear cut. One solution is to break master data into two types: master reference data and master business entity data. Master reference data has well defined and simple data structures, has simple keys and governance rules, is often standardized (US state codes, for example), involves only a few applications, and is reasonably stable. Master business entity data, such as customer, on the other hand, is usually ill-defined, has complex data structures and relationships, requires compound and intelligent keys and complex governance rules, is not usually standardized, involves many business processes, and changes frequently.

Does this distinction really matter? When developing data quality management and master data management systems it can do. Cleaning and managing master reference status is a reasonable easy job. The opposite is true for master business entity data.
