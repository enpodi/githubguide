Hello.

Tx for answering.

Actually I will be working near to North Quincy T station.

Do you have something close.
I need at least 50 minutes close by bus.
Or 50 minutes close by T train.

If commute is longer share me the details to consider.

Also I don¥t now if there are trains available on snow season.
In that case I will need also apatments or rooms with transportation available in snow season.

Thanks in advance.

who calls init and destroy method in a servlet?
jsp lifecycle
https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/servlet/ch03_03.htm
Just like applets, servlets can define init() and destroy() methods. A servlet's init(ServletConfig) method is called by the server immediately after the server constructs the servlet's instance. Depending on the server and its configuration, this can be at any of these times:

Serializable is a Marker interface wich does not has abstract methods

with reflexion you can change private fields into public. So, how can we make a class unmutable againt reflexion.

When the server starts

When the servlet is first requested, just before the service() method is invoked
At the request of the server administrator
In any case, init() is guaranteed to be called before the servlet handles its first request.

The init() method is typically used to perform servlet initialization--creating or loading objects that are used by the servlet in the handling 
of its requests. Why not use a constructor instead? Well, in JDK 1.0 (for which servlets were originally written), 
constructors for dynamically loaded Java classes (such as servlets) couldn't accept arguments. So, in order to provide a new servlet 
any information about itself and its environment, a server had to call a servlet's init() method and pass along an object that implements 
the ServletConfig interface. Also, Java doesn't allow interfaces to declare constructors. This means that the javax.servlet.Servlet interface 
cannot declare a constructor that accepts a ServletConfig parameter. It has to declare another method, like init(). It's still possible, of course, 
for you to define constructors for your servlets, but in the constructor you don't have access to the ServletConfig object or the ability to 
throw a ServletException.


DDL is Data Definition Language : it is used to define data structures.
 For example, with SQL, it would be instructions such as create table, alter table
DML is Data Manipulation Language : it is used to manipulate data itself.
 For example, with SQL, it would be instructions such as insert, update, delete, ...

The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is non synchronized and permits nulls. 
(HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas Hashtable doesn't allow nulls). 
HashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/volatile.html
The Java volatile keyword is used to mark a Java variable as "being stored in main memory". 
More precisely that means, that every read of a volatile variable will be read from the computer's main memory, 
and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache.
Actually, since Java 5 the volatile keyword guarantees more than just that volatile variables are written
 to and read from main memory. I will explain that in the following sections.
 The Java volatile keyword guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads. This may sound a bit abstract, so let me elaborate.

runtimeexception, checked exception unchecked exception

Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. 
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. 
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands, whereas DELETE is a DML command.
truncate is not "transactional" in the sense that it commits and can't be rolled back, and can modify object storage attributes. 
So it's not ordinary DML - Oracle classifies it as DDL(Data Definition Language). delete is an ordinary DML  (Data Manipulation Language) statement.

Early Binding and Late binding
The compiler performs a process called binding when an object is assigned to an object variable. The early binding (static binding) refers to compile time binding and late binding (dynamic binding) refers to runtime binding.
Early Binding (Static binding)
When perform Early Binding, an object is assigned to a variable declared to be of a specific object type. Early binding objects are basically a strong type objects or static type objects. While Early Binding, methods, functions and properties which are detected and checked during compile time and perform other optimizations before an application executes. The biggest advantage of using early binding is for performance and ease of development.
While prforming Early Binding the compiler can ensure at compile time that the function will exist and be callable at runtime. Moreover the compiler guarantees that the function takes the exact number of arguments and that they are of the right type and can checks that the return value is of the correct type.

Late binding (Dynamic binding)
By contrast, in Late binding functions, methods, variables and properties are detected and checked only at the run-time. It implies that the compiler does not know what kind of object or actual type of an object or which methods or properties an object contains until run time. The biggest advantages of Late binding is that the Objects of this type can hold references to any object, but lack many of the advantages of early-bound objects
Above code does not require a reference to be set beforehand, the instance creation and type determination will just happen at runtime. It is important to note that the Late binding can only be used to access type members that are declared as Public. Accessing members declared as Friend or Protected Friend resulted in a run-time error.
While perform late binding there is a possibility of the target function may not exist. Aslo the target function may not accept the arguments passed to it, and may have a return value of the wrong type.

six thread states:  runnable, blocked, waiting, timed_waiting, new, terminated.
RUNNABLE The thread is actively invoking code (native methods, native machine code)
WAITING The threat will wait indefinitely unless some other thread wakes it up.   <<  Object.wait()  << LockSupport.park()
TIMED_WAITING timed waiting  << Thread.sleep(time)  << LockSupport.parkNanos()
BLOCKED  The thread is waiting for a monitor lock to become available.


threads   TRANSIENT
transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes. When an object is transferred through the network, the object needs to be 'serialized'. Serialization converts the object state to serial bytes.

The fundamental difference is wait() is from Object and sleep() 
is static method of Thread . The major difference is that wait() releases the lock while sleep() doesn't releas any lock while waiting. The wait() is used for inter-thread communication while sleep() is used to introduce pause on execution, generally.

The most obvious difference is that the JPA specification defines the persist method. You can use it with all JPA implementations. The save method, on the other hand, is Hibernate-specific. It is, therefore, not available in other JPA implementations.
Another obvious difference between these 2 methods is their return type. JPAís persist method returns void and Hibernateís save method returns the primary key of the entity.
Hibernate executes the same SQL statements when you call the persist or the save method. Which and when it does that depends on your primary key generation strategy:
>>>Not generated<<<
If you set the primary key value programmatically, e.g. to a natural identifier, Hibernate only performs an SQL INSERT statement when it flushes the persistence context.
>>>Generated with IDENTITY strategy<<<
If you use the IDENTITY strategy to generate the primary key value, Hibernate needs to execute the INSERT statement when you call the save or persist method to retrieve the primary key value from the database.
>>>Generated with SEQUENCE strategy<<<
And if you use the SEQUENCE, Hibernate performs an SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the next value from the database sequence. Hibernate then delays the INSERT statement until it flushes the persistence context. In this example, the flush happens when the transaction gets committed.
>>>Generated with TABLE strategy<<<
You shouldnít use the TABLE strategy because it requires row level locks on the primary key table and doesnít scale well. If you use this strategy anyways, Hibernate performs an SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the next primary key value from the database and writes the new value to the database table. It delays the execution of the SQL INSERT statement for the new entity until it flushes the persistence context.

Master Data versus Reference Data
Master data is defined as data about the key business entities of an organization. Examples include customer, product, organizational structure, and chart of accounts. A common question about master data is, ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between master data and reference data?‚Äù Some people take the position that they are the same thing, but it can be argued that not all reference data is master data. For example, lookup and code tables that are used to encode information, such as state names and order codes, are not strictly master data tables.

The diving line between master data and reference data is not always clear cut. One solution is to break master data into two types: master reference data and master business entity data. Master reference data has well defined and simple data structures, has simple keys and governance rules, is often standardized (US state codes, for example), involves only a few applications, and is reasonably stable. Master business entity data, such as customer, on the other hand, is usually ill-defined, has complex data structures and relationships, requires compound and intelligent keys and complex governance rules, is not usually standardized, involves many business processes, and changes frequently.

Does this distinction really matter? When developing data quality management and master data management systems it can do. Cleaning and managing master reference status is a reasonable easy job. The opposite is true for master business entity data.

Code Test:

Sum Of Two:
Given an Array A = {-2,3,8,4,6,10,2,5}
Target Sum = 8
List l1 = {-2,3,8,4,6,10,2,5}
loop(i=0 -> length) //O(n)
if(l1.contains(i-ts)){
print(i,l1.get(i-ts));
}
 
Output:
