git status


git init
git add .
 git config --global user.email enpodi@yahoo.com.mx
 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/enpodi       XXXXXXXXX   FIRST A REPOSITORY HAS TO BE CREATED IN THE WEB PAGE
 
 git remote -v

 git push origin master
 
 
 login and create a repository. then
 git remote add origin https://github.com/enpodi/githubguide.git
 
 fatal: remote origin already exist
 
 TL;DR you should just update the existing remote:

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ppreyer/first_app.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/enpodi/githubguide.git

 git push origin master
 
 git commit -m "first log graph works but simple"

git config --global core.pager cat

git show-ref master

#after commiting locally
git fetch
#there are 2 branches: master (local) and origin/master.
# so from our local head branch (master) we run:
git merge origin/master       #WE ARENOT REWRITING HISTORY. MERGES NEVER DO THAT. INSTEAD, THEY JUST ADD NEW OBJECTS.
#"git  push"   followed by    "git merge"   is reduced with:
git pull

git --no-pager log --oneline -n 10
--no-pager will encounter the (END) word
-n 10 will show only the last 10 commits
--oneline will show the commit message, ignore the author, date information
  
GRAPH

log --graph --pretty=format
  lg = log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit

git lg
git lg1
 git lg2
 I have two aliases I normally throw in my ~/.gitconfig file:

[alias]
lg1 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --all
lg2 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)%n''          %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)' --all
lg = !"git lg1"

git fetch all           //brings all the branches from the remote repository



git reset HEAD                  //  this is default reset and implyes   --mixed, which only updates index area from the remote repository. The working area stays untouched
git reset --hard HEAD       //this overrides working area and index with the HEAD branch in the remote repository.
git stash --include-untracked                    //untracked files are saved in the stash area.    And checks out with the current commit (synchronized with remote repository and in clean status)
git stash apply        //retrieves the data from the most recent history, if there is only one then it is stash@{0}


git stash clear          //if files in the stash are not needed any more, then history in the stash area can be cleanes
git stash list          // list elements in stash history. It can be used to verify that stash was cleared with... git stash clear



How merge master with another branch:
first you checkou to master branch, and then you execute... git merge anotherbranch

if there is a conflict, it will popup a message stating... CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in recipes/guacamole.txt
Also ...   git status  ... highligths the file with conflict


see content with ... cat fileinconflict
<<<<<<<HEAD branch
Onion
========
Tomato
>>>>>>>tomato branch



during merge some references are created:
ls .git                   //list temporary files with references to file in conflict  
cat .git/MERGE_HEAD      ///(MERGE_HEAD  - bf0d97a )
git show   bf0d97a           // shows the content of one of the sides of the conflict    

vim   recipes/guacamole.txt     //open file in conflict and fix conflict
git commit             // once file in conflict is fixed.  we only execute...   git commit ... to notify git that the merge is done.
