git status


git init
git add .
 git config --global user.email enpodi@yahoo.com.mx
 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/enpodi       XXXXXXXXX   FIRST A REPOSITORY HAS TO BE CREATED IN THE WEB PAGE
 
 git remote -v

 git push origin master
 
 
 login and create a repository. then
 git remote add origin https://github.com/enpodi/githubguide.git
 
 fatal: remote origin already exist
 
 TL;DR you should just update the existing remote:

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ppreyer/first_app.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/enpodi/githubguide.git

 git push origin master
